# Arduino UVA/UVB/UVI Network Server

The code in `uvi_server.ino` will send UVA/UVB/UVI measurements to a network server.

## Requirements

You'll need the following hardware to make this work:

* Arduino IDE
* UV sensor library
* Gravity VEML6075 UV Sensor Module
* An Arduino board

## TODO

Need to clean up the code a bit as I plopped it all down in one file while getting it to work
