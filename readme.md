# Arduino UVA/UVB/UVI Network Server

The code in `uvi_server.ino` will send UVA/UVB/UVI measurements to a network server. I use the one I built to see if I need to put on sunscreen.

## Requirements

You'll need the following to make this work:

* An Arduino board such as the ESP8266 12-E NodeMCU Kit (one I used)
* Gravity VEML6075 UV Sensor Module
* Arduino IDE
* [UV sensor library](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_VEML6075)
* Network libraries that are used

## TODO

Need to clean up the code a bit as I plopped it all down in one file while getting it to work
